## Story of this game 📚
--------------------------

This game was created as a **solo project**, inspired by everyday school life. The idea was to simulate the struggle of **carrying too many books** while walking—a challenge many students face! 

The **physics mechanics** were carefully designed to create a **realistic balancing system**, making the game tricky yet rewarding. Players must **adjust movements, tilt their device, or use precise keyboard controls** to prevent the books from tumbling over.

Building this game was a deep dive into **physics-based gameplay**, where every movement and interaction had to feel **natural and challenging**. It was an exciting learning experience, testing both creativity and technical skills to ensure the **perfect balance** between fun and frustration!
